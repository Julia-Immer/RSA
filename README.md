# RSA
An implementation and exploration of RSA encryption and the mathematics behind it

This is a porject focused on implementing and exploring the RSA encryption scheme.
The starting place for it was a jupyter notebook provided to me by a professor containing function signatures only.  I am in the process of changing the naming and styling to be more PEP 8 compliant and cohesive with my own style.
In addition to exploring Fast Modular Exponentiation, Bezout Coefficients, and the other basic building blocks for RSA, the project provides encryption and decryption capabilities for both text and audio files.
A personal area of interest is audio programming which is why I added this portion to the project.
