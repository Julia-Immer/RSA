    "# Introduction to the RSA Encryption System\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSA encryption system was named after the three people, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, who invisioned it in 1977. Before RSA, one party would need to securely distribute secret keys to each of the parties who wish to encrypt data to send to them.  If the secret key was compromised by the outside party or in transit, the encryption would be compromised entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, researchers sought a system where one party could send encrypted messages to another, and even if the method and key being used to encrypt were discovered, those messages would be impossible to decode. \n",
    "\n",
    "RSA was born as a solution and the basics of this encryption scheme are included in this project.  Inside this document you will find a mix of functions and code to encrypt and decrypt, as well as break simple encryptions, and a deep dive into some of the basic mathematics and mechanics behind the scheme."

    "## RSA Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before RSA, if an encryption key got compromised, the entire scheme would be compromised.  With RSA, however, parties can receive all the encrypted messages they want as long as they have the private key, and they do not need to worry about the people sending messages accidentally compromising their encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to the RSA encryption system lies in the fascinating relationship between composite numbers, their prime number factorizations, and modular mathematics.  To create an encryption scheme like RSA, researchers needed to find an function which was easy to calculate, but difficult to reverse once calculated.  This function would take in messages, transformed into their number represenations, and transform them into new, difficult to decipher numbers, creating the encryption.  They were able to find such a function using modular math and exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further down in this project I will show you more of how RSA works and the mathematics behind it."

    "Factoring large composite numbers is famously believed to be difficult and time consuming. Efficient methods have been sought after but the best methods can only be employed with some knowledge of the crypto system used or with special conditions being satisfied by the number being factored.  The time taken by general purpose algorithms factoring n is entirely dependent on the length of the digit n.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase research in the area of number theory and the difficulty of factorization, the RSA Laboratories created a challenge in 1991 offering cash prizes to those who successfully break the RSA system.  The first challenge, RSA-100, or RSA using a 100 digit decimal number was broken only a couple weeks after the challenge was released.  The factorization took a few days with the technology at the time.\n",

    "As numbers become larger and larger, their difficulty in factorization increases exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make factoring harder, the RSA system should choose prime numbers p and q at random and let them be only a few digits different in length.  Since the frequency of primes decreases dramatically as integers become larger and larger, choosing primes that are very large and close to each other in length ensures it will take longer to find either of those special prime factors. Once either p or q is found, finding the other prime is as easy as dividing n by the new prime factor.\n",

With it, mute people can talk and our phones can talk back to us as well.\n",

    "It also introduces many problems, primarily the problem of people's voices being stolen and synthesized without their approval.  This new ability to synthesize human speech believably has far reaching poilitcal and social implications.  A famous person or politician could have their voice stolen through unencrypted audio clips sitting on the web on youtube or through calls intercepted.  The unathorized party could then use that data and synthesized voice to impersonate said politician and \"leak\" very believable but entirely fake audio.\n",

    "We can use RSA to encrypt audio just as we can use it to encrypt text.  To encrypt audio, I created two functions, encode_audio() and decode_and_play_audio(), to take in an audio file and change it into an array of bytes.  It then saves the file in the current folder which you can download to listen to.\n",
